Graph neural networks apply the predictive power of deep learning to rich data structures that depict objects and their relationships as points connected by lines in a graph. In GNNs, data points are called nodes, which are linked by lines — called edges — with elements expressed mathematically so machine learning algorithms can make useful predictions at the level of nodes, edges or entire graphs.
