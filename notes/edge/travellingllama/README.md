<b>Theme </b>: AI on Edge - Develop AI solutions optimised for edge devices, ensuring real-time processing without cloud reliance.
</p>

### Problem:

<p align="justify">
Travelers in remote areas, such as hikers, or people living in regions with limited or no regular internet connectivity, often struggle to access real-time travel information like route suggestions, locality information from locals, weather updates, or local cultural knowledge. This issue is even more critical during natural disasters, when internet infrastructure may fail entirely, leaving people without access to vital information. Traditional travel apps, which depend on cloud services, become unusable without a stable internet connection and may compromise user privacy.
</p>

### Solution:

<p align="justify">
Travelling Llama is an offline, edge-powered travel companion app that provides personalized travel recommendations and real-time information about everything within a 10 km radius of a geolocation, even in areas without internet access. By using Metaâ€™s Llama 3.2 model, optimized for edge devices, the app offers localized route suggestions, locality information from locals, weather forecasts, cultural insights, and safety alerts tailored to individual user preferences. It operates entirely offline, ensuring data privacy through on-device processing. This solution is perfect for hikers, people living in remote areas, and regions affected by natural disasters.

## Implementation : Travelling Llama - Edge AI Travel Companion Using Llama 3.2 with RAG

<p align="justify">
To implement the solution using Metaâ€™s Llama 3.2 1-bit model with 1 billion parameters, we integrate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to handle custom queries, improve the personalization of responses, and create an offline travel assistant.
