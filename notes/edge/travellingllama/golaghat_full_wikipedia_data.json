It is one of the oldest urban areas in Assam that recently featured on the Smart Cities nominations list, along with Guwahati and four other prominent urban areas of the state; although losing out to Guwahati at the final stage. The Dhansiri, one of the tributaries of the Brahmaputra, passes through Golaghat and is the primary water source for its citizens.\nOne of the earliest tea urban centres in Assam that has been the headquarters of the oldest subdivision for over 186\u2013187 years since 1839, the local government body, Golaghat Municipal Board (GMB), was set up in early 1920, becoming a long-established civic body of the state, formed before independent India. It is a historical body of 105\u2013106 years of age in continuous operation.\nGolaghat has the inceptive post/mail service and telegraphic communication systems in Assam going back to 1876. The oldest social \u2013 literature/rhetorical congresses of Assam \u2013 the Golaghat Sahitya Sabha of Asam Sahitya Sabha, also began here in 1918. The Golaghat Amateur Theatre Society (GATS), one of the premier theater societies of the state, was set up here in 1895  to uplift the dramatic and cultural activities in the region, particularly Golaghat. The Golaghat Bar Association (GBA), founded in 1891, is one of the oldest legal societies in Assam, especially in the Upper \u2013 Assam division.\nGolaghat has a number of heritage buildings and sites \u2013 the Golaghat British Cemetery, constructed in 1876, the Bezbaruah Higher Secondary School, set up in the late 19th century in the year 1886 by the educationalist Dinanath Bezbarua, the Baptist Church founded by the American missionaries in 1898, the Christian High (Mission) School built by the American Women Foreign Mission Society in 1919, Assam's first department store \u2013 Doss & Co., constructed in 1930 and incorporated under the Registrar of Companies (RoC) \u2013 Shillong in the year 1955 to name a few.\nThe headquarters of Assam Valley Tea Planters' Association (now Assam Tea Planters Association) was also based in Golaghat. Set up in 1941 under Mahendra Nath Barooah's management, the erstwhile headquarters played a significant role in enrolling associate members, besides laying the first foundations of growth, recognition and reputation that the association is presently credited for. Golaghat also has one of the oldest boards of trades and industries in the state. The United Chamber of Commerce (UCC) formed in 1954 antecedes many newer chambers of commerce that have been set up in the state in the more recent years.\nAssam's first major political party, the AGP was formed here and launched in the year 1985 at the historic Golaghat Convention and by 2008; the same members of the convention reunified the party at this place.\nThe place is also the headquarters of The North Eastern Tea Association (NETA), one of the tea growers' groups in the state of Assam, a constituent member of Consultative Committee of Plantation Associations (CCPA), Assam Valley branch.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name Golaghat (gola which means shop and ghat meaning the landing point of river ferry or enclosure for boats) originated from the shops established by the Marwari businessmen during the mid-20th century at the bank of  Dhansiri river near present Golaghat.\nThere is another view, which is more sophisticated and older than the arrival of the British and Indian businessmen. During the Ahom kingdom era, there was a storehouse of cannonballs also locally called Gola and transported by local ferry Ghat, from which name Golaghat is derived.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 9th century ===\nThe stone inscription of Nagajari-khanikar village of Sarupathar, dating back to the 5th century, reveals that there was an independent kingdom in Doyang \u2013 Dhansiri valley and the relics of ramparts, brick structures, temples and tanks etc. discovered in these areas suggest the presence of a kingdom during 9th and 10th century.\n\n\n=== With Ming dynasty ===\nEarlier, this part was ruled by the Dimasa Kingdom. The Ming dynasty had contact with  the Dimasas and canonised the Dimasa kingdom as a tusi in 1406. \nThe Ming court sent Zhou Rang, a Supervising Secretary to bestow  Imperial orders, patent, seals, paper money, silks etc. to the kingdomand in return, the chieftain of Dimasa sent horses and local products as a sign of tribute.\n\n\n=== Under Ahoms ===\nThe Doyang \u2013 Dhansiri valley came under the rule of Ahom dynasty during the 16th century.   During Ahom rule, this area was under Morongi-khowa Gohain, an administrative officer.\n\n\n=== Early modern ===\nIn 1751, certain portions of Barpathar, Sarupathar Barangi mauzas of Golaghat circle and Duarbagari of Bokakhat circle were transferred to the United Mikir and N.C. Hills districts.\nDuring the last phrase of the Ahom kingdom, when the independent sovereignty of Ahoms had come to an end, Purandar Singha was entrusted in 1833 with the administration of Upper \u2013 Assam by the East India Company who had already won mastery over Assam. However, this artificial ornamentation by the scion of Ahom Royal House was short-lived, and in the year 1838, the whole area was resumed by the authorities of the company and annexed to the British territory with the appointment of Col. Aham White as the political agent on 16 September during the same year.\nBy a proclamation in 1839, the British took possession of Assam and the area was divided into two districts of Lakhimpur and Sibsagar, where the Doyang \u2013 Dhansiri valley was included under the newly formed Golaghat subdivision of Sibsagar district in 1839. Golaghat became the largest subdivision in Assam and comprised Dergaon and Golaghat circles. Golaghat circle was the largest among them with 150.10 square miles of area, while Dergaon was the smallest. During this time, Purandar Singha continued to rule with Jorhat as the capital of his territory, Upper \u2013 Assam, but with the formation of two other subdivisions, one at Jaipur and the other at Golaghat.\nOn 18 December 1846, Jorhat was declared a subdivision comprising certain portions of Golaghat subdivision. \nThe earliest head post offices of the Assam circle of British Assam were located in Golaghat besides Debrughur, Goahati, Jorhat, Nowgong, Sibsagar, Shillong and Tezpore.\n\n \nMuch later after telegraph lines had been stretched between Calcutta and Guwahati in 1869; Golaghat got its speaking wires' system in and around 1876. The lines were stretched to connect Golaghat with Kohima, Shillong with Goahati, Sibsagar with Nazerah and Debrughur with Makum.\n\nIn British Assam, Golaghat derived its importance chiefly because of having advanced communication systems during that time and on account of its connection by road with Kohima. One of the oldest railway lines in Assam was also built in Golaghat. The text noted from the book Glimpse of Assam written by Mrs. S.R. Ward in 1884 state: Mr Bryers who was then the Chief of Cachar and Assam Railway Survey succeeded in finding a railway route that would be carried up the Dhunsiri valley to Golaghat... thus giving Assam direct railway communication with Chittagong and Calcutta.\n\n\n=== Late modern and contemporary ===\nGolaghat elevated to the position of a full-fledged district in Assam comprising an area of 3,502 km2 (or 1, 352.13 sq. mi) on 5 October 1987 and is known for its notable contribution in India's independence movement, arts and culture, literature and sports in the region.\n\nKushal Konwar, Kamala Miri, Dwariki Das, Biju Vaishnav, Sankar Chandra Barua, Tara Prasad Barooah, Maheshwar Barooah, Rajendra Nath Barua, Gaurilal Jain, Ganga Ram Bormedhi and Dwarikanath Goswami are Indian independence activists of the town.\nThe 19th century writer, Hem Chandra Barua, who authored the first Assamese dictionary Hemkosh hailed from Golaghat.\nGhanashyam Barua, a resident of this place, reckoned in the field of politics as the first Central Minister of Assam, translated William Shakespeare's The Comedy of Errors into Assamese along with three of his partners.\nSeveral national and international sportspeople in fields of athletics, table tennis, tennis, boxing and football have come from Golaghat.\nNumaligarh Refinery is the biggest revenue generating industrial sector in Golaghat.\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\n\n=== Local government ===\n\nThe administration of Golaghat is formed of two tiers: a city-wide and a local tier.

The long agitation ended with the signing of the Assam Accord on the independence day in 1985. The leaders of the Assam Agitation formed the AGP on 14 October 1985, in Golaghat and the party later that year overthrew the Indian National Congress led by late Hiteswar Saikia.\nGolaghat is a part of Kaliabor (Lok Sabha constituency).
