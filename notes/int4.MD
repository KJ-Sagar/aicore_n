Abstract:  Training deep neural networks (DNNs) is becoming increasingly more resource- and energy-intensive every year. Unfortunately, existing works primarily focus on optimizing DNN training for faster completion, often without considering the impact on energy efficiency.
In this paper, we observe that common practices to improve training performance can often lead to inefficient energy usage. More importantly, we demonstrate that there is a tradeoff between energy consumption and performance optimization. To this end, we propose Zeus, an optimization framework to navigate this tradeoff by automatically finding optimal job- and GPU-level configurations for recurring DNN training jobs. Zeus uses an online exploration-exploitation approach in conjunction with just-in-time energy profiling, averting the need for expensive offline measurements, while adapting to data drifts over time. Our evaluation shows that Zeus can improve the energy efficiency of DNN training by 15.3%–75.8% for diverse workloads.

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have seen widespread adoption in various data-driven domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, personalized recommendation, and speech recognition. To support this growth, DNN models are primarily trained on clusters of highly parallel and powerful GPUs . However, the increasing computational demand has led to greater energy consumption. For example, training the GPT-3 model requires 1,287 megawatt-hours (MWh) [[source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10350)], equivalent to the electricity used by an average U.S. household over 120 years. Despite efforts to reduce operational power footprints, like Meta's 28.5% reduction, the energy demand for AI continues to rise. Existing literature on DNN training largely overlooks energy efficiency [[paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3381831)].

Our research highlights that common performance optimization practices for DNN training often result in inefficient energy usage. Recent works suggest using large batch sizes to enhance training throughput [[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00489), [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02677)], but this can lower energy efficiency. We found that setting appropriate batch sizes and GPU power limits can reduce energy consumption by 23.8%–74.7% across different workloads.

Reducing energy consumption, however, involves tradeoffs. We discovered a balance between energy use and training time for achieving target accuracy. Our analysis of the energy-time Pareto frontier reveals two key insights: first, all Pareto-optimal configurations offer varying degrees of energy savings compared to using maximum batch sizes and GPU power limits indiscriminately. Second, the reduction in energy consumption often exhibits a non-linear relationship with the increase in training time. This raises the question: how can we automatically identify and manage the tradeoff between energy consumption and training time for DNN training?
