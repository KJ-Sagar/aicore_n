# End-to-End SLAM System :

Knowing the principles of bricks and cement does not mean that you can build a
grand palace. We will implement a simplified version of stereo VO and then see its running effect in the Kitti dataset. This VO consists of a frontend of optical flow tracking and a backend of sliding window BA.

Goal :
+ Implement a stereo visual SLAM from scratch.
+ Understand the problems that are prone to occur in VO and how to fix them.
