# SLAM

Ok, let's code a visual SLAM from scratch in c++. I am learning from my notes @github/[autonomy_perception](https://github.com/florist-notes/aicore_s/blob/main/notes/perc.MD),  @github/[robotics-slam](https://github.com/florist-notes/aicore_s/blob/main/notes/robotics_ee_hardware/roboticsmech.MD) and companion guide '[Introduction to Visual SLAM](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-16-4939-4)' : [ [code](https://github.com/gaoxiang12/slambook2/tree/master) : [booken](https://github.com/gaoxiang12/slambook-en) ]. Example: [ORB SLAM 3](https://github.com/UZ-SLAMLab/ORB_SLAM3), [FastSLAM](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-540-46402-0).

## Introduction to SLAM 
### 3D Rigid Body Motion :

Overview of a SLAM system. It describes each module of a
typical SLAM system and explains what to do and how to do it. 
### Lie Group and Lie Algebra :

Lie group and Lie algebra. Lie group manipulation with Sophus.

### Cameras and Images :

Pinhole camera model and image expression in computer. OpenCV to retrieve the cameraâ€™s intrinsic and extrinsic parameters and
generate a point cloud using the depth information through Point Cloud Library (PCL) .
### Nonlinear Optimization : 

 Nonlinear optimization, including state estimation, least squares, and gradient descent methods, e.g., Gauss-Newton and Levenburg-Marquardt method. Curve-fitting problem using the Ceres and g2o library.


## SLAM Technologies 

### Visual Odometry :

Feature-based visual odometry, which is currently the mainstream
in VO. Feature extraction and matching, epipolar geometry calculation, Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm, Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm, and Bundle Adjustment (BA), etc. OpenCV functions or constructing our own optimization problem in Ceres and g2o.

 Direct (or intensity-based) method for VO ; Optical flow principle and the direct method. Writing single layer and multi-layer optical flow and direct method to implement a two-view VO.

### Filters and Optimization Approaches :

Bundle Adjustment in detail and show the relationship between its sparse structure and the corresponding graph model. Ceres and g2o separately to solve the same BA problem.

Pose graph in the backend optimization. Pose graph is a more
compact representation for BA, which converts all map points into constraints between keyframes. g2o to optimize a pose graph.

### Loop Closure :

Loop closure detection, mainly Bag-of-Word (BoW) based method.
Use DBoW3 to train a dictionary from images and detect loops in
videos.

### Dense Reconstruction :

 Estimate the depth of pixels in monocular SLAM (and show why they are unreliable). Compared with monocular depth estimation, building a dense map with RGB-D cameras is much easier. Write programs for epipolar line search and patch matching to estimate depth from monocular images and then build a point cloud map and octagonal treemap from RGB-D data.

### SLAM Discussion:


 Open-Source implementations : MonoSLAM, PTAM, ORB-SLAM Series, LSD-SLAM, SVO, RTAB-MAP ; IMU-Integrated VSLAN, Semantic SLAM.
