I made a video on Reinforcement Learning  - "A.I. learns to play Mario " [ [video](https://youtu.be/0EGWbqH3Li0) ] few years back and my bachelor thesis was : "Actor-Critic and Q-value reinforcement learning with GANs for autonomous driving" where I compared performance of
DRL algorithms - DQN, A2C, A3C, DDPG and PPO in [CARLA](https://carla.org/). I also [graduated](https://graduation.udacity.com/confirm/W4DQ2JCV) from Udacity's Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree.
