# Introduction
Artificial Intelligence is about mimicking the human senses to its truest forms:
```
ðŸ’  COMPUTER VISION < What we see
ðŸ’  NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING < What we speak, read or hear
ðŸ’  REINFORCEMENT LEARNING < How we learn from experience
ðŸ’  AUGMENTED REALITY < Digital twin of the environment where we live
ðŸ’  ROBOTICS < What we can touch
ðŸ’  SENSOR FUSION & EDGE ELECTRONICS < How we feel, smell and taste
ðŸ’  MACHINE LEARNING < learn about the world around us
        + SUPERVISED LEARNING < give labels & information
        + UNSUPERVISED LEARNING < let ML algo find patterns itself
        + META LEARNING < learn about the learnings of the world around us
In addition:
ðŸ’  SYSTEMS and DATA CENTER < How we remember and make use of known tools
ðŸ’  MATHEMATICS < rule of nature that governs patterns and logic
```

DATA: Everything in CS is 0 or 1. Life has been binary! Most common data formats: Image / Video / Audio / Text / etc (other formats).
