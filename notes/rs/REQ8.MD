The software includes various graphical user interfaces, interactive modes, and one-click processing modes. It supports data imports from at least 12 domestic and international commercial/open-source SAR satellites, including but not limited to Gaofen-3, Jilin-1, Haiyang-1, Ziyuan-1, ALOS-1, TerraSAR-X, SAOCOM, Radarsat-1/2, COSMO-SkyMed-1/2, and more.
It supports image co-registration, single/double satellite InSAR (Interferometric SAR) functions, secondary differential InSAR and batch differential functions, Stacking, POT, MAI, SBAS, and TSInSAR for deformation monitoring. Additionally, the software can conduct optical stereoscopic 3D imaging, radiometric calibration, terrain extraction, polarimetric processing, multi-track fusion, GNSS point cloud merging, and multi-track 3D deformation processing. Users are also supported in defining their custom processing workflows.
