# Remote Sensing üõ∞Ô∏è

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Remote sensing refers to the process of acquiring information about an object or phenomenon without making physical contact with it. This is typically achieved by detecting and analyzing reflected or emitted electromagnetic radiation from the Earth's surface and atmosphere. It plays a crucial role in various fields, including environmental monitoring, urban planning, agriculture, forestry, disaster management, and defense.

## How Remote Sensing Works

+ `Energy Source or Illumination` : A source (usually the Sun or an artificial emitter) provides electromagnetic radiation. Passive sensors rely on natural energy, while active sensors generate their own signal (e.g., radar).

+ `Propagation of Energy` : The energy travels through the atmosphere, interacts with the Earth's surface, and is reflected or emitted back.

+ `Interaction with Objects` : Different surfaces (water, vegetation, soil) interact differently with radiation, depending on their physical and chemical properties.

+ `Sensor Reception` : Sensors aboard satellites, aircraft, or drones capture the reflected/emitted radiation and convert it into data.

+ `Data Processing` : The raw data undergo preprocessing (removing noise, correcting distortions) and analysis to extract meaningful information.

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Remote sensing employs a variety of sensors to capture data from the Earth's surface and atmosphere. These sensors differ based on the energy source, platform, wavelength sensitivity, and application. Below is a detailed explanation of the different types of sensors used in remote sensing.

### Classification of Sensors :

A. Based on Energy Source
+ `Passive Sensors`:
These sensors rely on natural energy sources, primarily sunlight. They measure the energy reflected or emitted by objects on the Earth's surface.
    + `Examples`: Optical cameras, multispectral scanners, thermal sensors.

+ `Active Sensors`:
These sensors emit their own energy (typically in the form of electromagnetic waves) and measure the reflected signal from the target.
    + `Examples`: Radar (Radio Detection and Ranging), LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging).

B. Based on Platform
+ `Spaceborne Sensors`: Mounted on satellites, they provide global and large-area coverage.
    + `Examples`: Landsat, Sentinel, MODIS.

+ `Airborne Sensors`: Mounted on aircraft or drones for high-resolution, localized imaging.
    + `Examples`: Hyperspectral imagers on drones, LiDAR on airplanes.

+ `Ground-Based Sensors`: Deployed on the Earth's surface for localized and high-precision data collection.
    + `Examples`: Spectroradiometers, soil moisture probes.

C. Based on Wavelength Sensitivity
+ `Optical Sensors`: Operate in the visible, near-infrared (NIR), and short-wave infrared (SWIR) regions.
+ `Thermal Infrared Sensors`: Measure emitted thermal radiation, providing data on temperature.
+ `Microwave Sensors`: Operate in the microwave region and can penetrate clouds, vegetation, and even soil.

## Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) :

<img src="./img/dem.png" width=100%>

<p style="text-align:justify;">

A `Digital Elevation Model (DEM)` is a digital representation of the Earth's surface topography or terrain. It is a 3D depiction of the elevation data, often used in various fields such as geography, geology, hydrology, environmental science, urban planning, and remote sensing.
</p>


<p style="text-align:justify;">
DEMs are typically represented as a raster grid where each cell (or pixel) holds an elevation value corresponding to the terrain at that location. The resolution of a DEM refers to the size of each grid cell. High-resolution DEMs have smaller cells, capturing finer details of the terrain, while low-resolution DEMs are coarser. Elevation values in DEMs are usually measured in meters or feet above a reference point, often mean sea level. DEM accuracy depends on the source data and methods used to create the model. Errors can arise due to noise in data collection, interpolation methods, or data processing. The spatial resolution of a DEM refers to the distance between elevation points (e.g., 1 m, 30 m, or 90 m grid spacing).
</p>

Types of DEMs:

+ `Digital Surface Model (DSM)`: Includes all surface features like buildings, vegetation, and other objects.
+ `Digital Terrain Model (DTM)`: Represents the bare ground surface without any objects, derived by removing vegetation and man-made structures from the DSM.

### DEM Processing Techniques

+ Interpolation:
    + Filling in gaps between elevation points using methods such as Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW), Kriging, or Spline interpolation.

+ Filtering:
    + Removing noise or anomalies from the elevation data.

+ Resampling:
    + Changing the resolution of a DEM to make it coarser or finer.

+ Smoothing:
    + Reducing sharp changes in elevation to create a more realistic model.

+ Analysis Tools:
    + `Slope Calculation`: Determines the steepness of terrain.
    + `Aspect Analysis`: Identifies the direction a slope faces.
    + `Hillshade`: Simulates sunlight and shadows for visualization.
    + `Flow Direction and Accumulation`: Essential for hydrological studies.

### Choose the Best Data Source
Different data sources offer varying levels of accuracy. Select the most suitable one for your area of interest:

+ (a) LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)
    + Accuracy: High vertical accuracy (¬±10cm to ¬±1m) and resolutions of 1m or finer.
    + Coverage: Ideal for small to medium areas.
    + Applications: Urban planning, flood modeling, and forestry.
    + Availability:
        + Many governments provide LiDAR data (e.g., USGS 3DEP in the U.S.).
        + Commercial vendors like Hexagon or Bluesky provide high-resolution LiDAR data.

        `LAStools` Workflow:
        Use `lasground` to classify ground points.
        Use `las2dem` to generate a raster DEM from the ground-classified points.
        Export the DEM in GeoTIFF format.

+ (b) Satellite-based DEMs
    + TanDEM-X: High-resolution global DEM (~12m resolution, ~2m vertical accuracy).
    + SRTM: 30m resolution with ¬±16m vertical accuracy (global coverage).
    + ASTER GDEM: 30m resolution but less accurate than SRTM (¬±20m vertical accuracy).
    + Copernicus DEM: Global DEM with 30m and 10m resolution versions.

+ (c) Photogrammetry
    + Using high-resolution aerial or drone images with photogrammetry software (e.g., Pix4D, Agisoft Metashape) can produce DEMs with sub-meter accuracy.

+ (d) Ground-based Surveys
    + For the highest accuracy, traditional surveying techniques (e.g., total stations, GPS-based RTK systems) are unbeatable.
    + Applications: Small areas like construction sites or precision agriculture.
