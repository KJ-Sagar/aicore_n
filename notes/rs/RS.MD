# Remote Sensing üõ∞Ô∏è

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Remote sensing refers to the process of acquiring information about an object or phenomenon without making physical contact with it. This is typically achieved by detecting and analyzing reflected or emitted electromagnetic radiation from the Earth's surface and atmosphere. It plays a crucial role in various fields, including environmental monitoring, urban planning, agriculture, forestry, disaster management, and defense.

## How Remote Sensing Works

+ `Energy Source or Illumination` : A source (usually the Sun or an artificial emitter) provides electromagnetic radiation. Passive sensors rely on natural energy, while active sensors generate their own signal (e.g., radar).

+ `Propagation of Energy` : The energy travels through the atmosphere, interacts with the Earth's surface, and is reflected or emitted back.

+ `Interaction with Objects` : Different surfaces (water, vegetation, soil) interact differently with radiation, depending on their physical and chemical properties.

+ `Sensor Reception` : Sensors aboard satellites, aircraft, or drones capture the reflected/emitted radiation and convert it into data.

+ `Data Processing` : The raw data undergo preprocessing (removing noise, correcting distortions) and analysis to extract meaningful information.

Remote sensing employs a variety of sensors to capture data from the Earth's surface and atmosphere. These sensors differ based on the energy source, platform, wavelength sensitivity, and application. Below is a detailed explanation of the different types of sensors used in remote sensing.

### Classification of Sensors :

A. Based on Energy Source
+ `Passive Sensors`:
These sensors rely on natural energy sources, primarily sunlight. They measure the energy reflected or emitted by objects on the Earth's surface.
    + `Examples`: Optical cameras, multispectral scanners, thermal sensors.

+ `Active Sensors`:
These sensors emit their own energy (typically in the form of electromagnetic waves) and measure the reflected signal from the target.
    + `Examples`: Radar (Radio Detection and Ranging), LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging).

B. Based on Platform
+ `Spaceborne Sensors`: Mounted on satellites, they provide global and large-area coverage.
    + `Examples`: Landsat, Sentinel, MODIS.

+ `Airborne Sensors`: Mounted on aircraft or drones for high-resolution, localized imaging.
    + `Examples`: Hyperspectral imagers on drones, LiDAR on airplanes.

+ `Ground-Based Sensors`: Deployed on the Earth's surface for localized and high-precision data collection.
    + `Examples`: Spectroradiometers, soil moisture probes.

C. Based on Wavelength Sensitivity
+ `Optical Sensors`: Operate in the visible, near-infrared (NIR), and short-wave infrared (SWIR) regions.
+ `Thermal Infrared Sensors`: Measure emitted thermal radiation, providing data on temperature.
+ `Microwave Sensors`: Operate in the microwave region and can penetrate clouds, vegetation, and even soil.
