# Autonomous Driving (AI) : Vehicle Cut-in Detection [INT 1]

<p class="ex1" align="justify" style="padding: 15px 15px 15px 15px">
Artificial Intelligence (AI) based machine learning (ML) techniques are widely becoming used and
deployed in real-world applications. Autonomous driving is a technology that highly depends on a large
volume and variety of data for training and testing. India Driving Dataset (IDD) is an open dataset,
publicly available for research, and can be used for tasks like object detection and segmentation.
Download IDD Temporal from <a href="http://idd.insaan.iiit.ac.in/">idd.insaan.iiit.ac.in</a> and develop new (or better) machine learning
models for:

   + Detection of sudden cut-in of vehicles (two/three/four wheelers, pushcarts etc) into the direction
of driving


Outcomes: <br/>
▪ Train a new ML model for detecting cut-in. <br/>
▪ Use any extra data from other sources to augment training ML models. <br/>
▪ Calculate the accuracy of performance in detection. <br/>
▪ Create a 3-page report on the chosen problem, technical approach, and results. <br/>
